Squirrel Census Mapping 

Project 3

Contributors: Elijah Cannon, Kevin Ng, Andres Portes, Cody Westbrook

Using the 2018 Squirrel Census, we want to map Central Park and help people find where they could have the most success squirrel watching. The census was performed using a grid system, which we can rebuild in Choropleth. When the user selects the hectare, a 100^2 acre plot of land, individual pins will show up for each squirrel seen in the census in that hectare. Users could click on an individual pin to see physical descriptions of each squirrel and try to find ones that still live in the area.

When a hectare is chosen, we are thinking of including graphs of overall statistics of squirrels in that area to pair with the descriptions of individual squirrels.

We also hope to add markers for food stands and dog runs to test a hypothesis that food stands might result in a heavier concentration of sightings while dog runs would result in fewer sightings.
 
Project Features:

Full map of Central Park with grid replicating dataset built in choropleth to select hectare

Map markers of individual squirrel sightings logged by latitude/longitude

Table of physical characteristics of individual squirrels changing when unique markers are selected

Graphs of common physical traits of squirrels in hectare

Markers of food and dog run locations to test the correlation between their respective presence and squirrel density
